# **Capstone_foundations**
This is my midpoint capstone project for the DevMountain bootcamp I am attending. I decided to create a deckbuilder for the trading card game Magic: The Gatheringfor this project. I have used MTGSDK, Express, Cors, Axios, and Nodemon as dependencies in my .JSON. I did not create a database for my project as the amount of data to be imported is quite large, and I wanted to ensure I had time to finish a working page, so load times are not the greatest There are a few different Axios requests being used, as well as quite a bit of HTML and CSS. I did not use React, Bootstrap, or any other framework while making the site as I wanted to learn as much as I could aboout CSS and HTML functionality. The landing page automatically displays some cards just for aesthetic purposes, and the user may search for cards by Set, Color or Card Type (creature, instant, land, etc.),or any combination of those three options. On the Deck page, the user can choose 
the Set, and enter the card number (which is displayed on the home page), of any card they wish to add to their deck for futurereference. There is a delete button for each added card so a player may remove cards from their deck, whether to track which cards are actively in the deck, or perhaps to use this tool as a wish list of cards that are wanted or needed. I also added embellishments such as snowfall and drifting cherry blossoms, as well as alternating animated fade links and titles.

## **Technology:**
